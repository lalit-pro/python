// IMPORTANT: For Playwright to test a Chrome extension, you need to:
// 1. Build your extension into a 'dist' folder (or similar).
// 2. Configure playwright.config.js to launch Chrome with this extension loaded.
//    This usually involves setting `launchOptions.args` like:
//    `--disable-extensions-except=/path/to/your-ai-copilot/dist`
//    `--load-extension=/path/to/your-ai-copilot/dist`
//    And potentially setting `headless: false` for local debugging.
// This example assumes such a setup.

test.describe('YouTube Summarization E2E', () => {
  const EXTENSION_ID = ''; // This needs to be determined after loading the extension.
                           // It can be found by navigating to chrome://extensions in headed mode.
                           // Or by scripting its retrieval. This is a common challenge.

  // Helper to get the extension's page (e.g., popup or options)
  // async function getExtensionPage(page, path = 'html/popup.html') {
  //   if (!EXTENSION_ID) throw new Error("EXTENSION_ID is not set. Cannot open extension page.");
  //   await page.goto(`chrome-extension://${EXTENSION_ID}/${path}`);
  //   return page;
  // }

  test('should open popup and attempt to summarize a mock YouTube page', async ({ page, context }) => {
    // This test is highly conceptual without the extension loading mechanism fully defined.
    // For a real test, you'd navigate to a YouTube page.
    // Here, we'll simulate some actions that would happen if the extension was loaded.

    // 1. Navigate to a YouTube-like page (or mock one)
    // For a real test, this would be an actual YouTube URL.
    // For this example, let's assume we are on a page where the content script would activate.
    await page.goto('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'); // Example video

    // 2. Interact with the extension (e.g., open popup)
    // This is the hardest part to automate without a fixed EXTENSION_ID or a way to click the browser action.
    // One common pattern is to open the popup as a separate page if its URL is known.
    // await getExtensionPage(page, 'html/popup.html');
    // For now, let's assume the popup is open or its functionality is triggered.

    // Let's test a piece of functionality that might be testable if the content scripts are running
    // and can communicate with a mocked background script (very advanced setup).
    // Or, we could test the UI of the popup/sidebar directly if loaded.

    // Due to the complexity of fully E2E testing a Chrome extension's popup interaction
    // with a live page without a complex setup (like fixed extension ID, etc.),
    // this test will be more of a placeholder for the flow.

    // Expected flow:
    // - User opens popup on YouTube page.
    // - Clicks "Summarize Page" (or a specific "Summarize Video" button).
    // - Content script `youtubeExtractor.js` tries to get transcript.
    // - Transcript (or page text if no transcript) sent to `summarizer.js`.
    // - Summary displayed in sidebar/popup.

    // A more testable E2E scenario might be to load the sidebar HTML directly (if it's a web_accessible_resource)
    // and test its standalone UI logic with mocked chrome.runtime messages.

    // Placeholder: Check if the YouTube content script injected something (if it did)
    // This is a very basic check and depends on what your content script does.
    // For example, if youtubeExtractor.js added a specific element or attribute:
    // const injectedElement = await page.locator('#your-ai-copilot-youtube-marker'); // Fictional marker
    // await expect(injectedElement).toBeVisible();


    // A more realistic E2E test would involve:
    // - Loading the extension with a known ID.
    // - Navigating to a YouTube page.
    // - Clicking the extension's browser action icon to open the popup.
    // - Clicking the "Summarize" button in the popup.
    // - Waiting for the sidebar to appear (if that's the behavior).
    // - Verifying that the sidebar shows a summary or a "processing" message.
    // This requires a robust setup for launching Chrome with the extension.

    // For now, this test serves as a structural placeholder.
    // We'll assert something simple to make the test pass structurally.
    await expect(page.title()).toContain('YouTube');

    console.warn("Note: Full E2E test for extension popup interaction requires specific launch config for Playwright (loading unpacked extension). This test is a placeholder.");
